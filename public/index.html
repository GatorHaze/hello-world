    <div class="textbox"><p>The world wide web is just that, a giant intertangled connective network that millions of people all over the world are able to contribute to and absorb information from. When the internet first became popular it wasn’t  nearly as robust as it is now. The time period between 1998-2007 was when the explosion for the internet too place, and it has paved the way for the future of all the possibilities going forward.
The internet used to be only used on computer screens and was limited by what that computer was capable of displaying. The limitation caused a set of problems for the people who wanted to go beyond what was previously possible. As time has gone on, we have developed a deeper understanding of the web and have created tools to allow us to do more. The increased use of the web has given us the ability to have more information more accessible to us at any given time. There are positive and negatives to this accessibility. Positive things that we see from it is the ability to get weather information, traffic patterns, vacation packages or share pictures we just took with out mobile devices. On the other hand, the accessibility to the web has increased the distractions we have by our sides and it has helped muddy the waters of a work life balance, since it so easy to take work home with you. Just like most things in life, the web has a positive and negative side. Overall, I know that the positive far outweighs the negatives and I can't wait to see what future advancements are made utilizing the web.
